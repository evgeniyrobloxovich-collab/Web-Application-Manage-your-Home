Segment name: "Digital Manager"
Demographic and organizational characteristics:
1. Organization: A management company (CC) or a large HOA in a city with a population of one million or a regional center.
2. Portfolio size: From 20 to 500 apartment buildings (MCD) or commercial facilities. This is the "sweet spot": there is enough scale for manual management to become critically inefficient and expensive, but there is no in-house IT department to develop custom solutions.
3. Decision-maker position (LTV): Managing Director or Head of Operations. Age: 35-50 years. Values order, control, and digitalization, but is skeptical of "cloud" solutions due to security requirements and a desire to "own" the system.
4. Key user: Customer Service Dispatcher/Manager (female, 25-45 years old). Her main pain is the constant stress of phone calls and lost notes
